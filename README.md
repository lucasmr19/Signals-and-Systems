# Signals and Systems - MATLABÂ© Practices

This repository contains MATLAB exercises and practical sessions focusing on various topics related to "Signals and Systems."

### PRACTICE 1: Signals in MatLab
- Useful functions:
    - decompose_even_odd: return the even and odd parts of a given signal.
    - get_Energy_x_t: return the energy of a continuous given signal $x(t), t \in \mathbb{R}$.
    - get_Energy_x_t: return the energy of a discrete given signal $x[n], n \in \mathbb{Z}$.
    - get_Power: return the power of a given signal.
- exercise 1: Signal representation (`stem` command for discrete signals and `plot` command for contniuous signals).
- exercise 2: Signal transformations (Inversions and shiftings).
- exercise 3: Signal decompositions in his even and odd parts.
- exercise 4: Complex signal representation (using the matlab commands `real`, `imag`, `abs`, `angle`).
- exercise 4: Arithmetic operations with signals ( we use the `.` operator for element-wise operations).

### PRACTICE 2: Periodicity
