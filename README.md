# Signals and Systems - MATLABÂ© Practices

This repository contains MATLAB exercises and practical sessions focusing on various topics related to "Signals and Systems."

### PRACTICE 1: Signals in MatLab
- Useful functions: we going to create differents functions:
    - decompose_even_odd: return the even and odd parts of a given signal.
    - get_Energy_x_t: return the energy of a continuous signal $x(t), t \in \mathbb{R}$ 
    - get_Energy_x_t: return the energy of a discrete signal $x[n], n \in \mathbb{Z}$
